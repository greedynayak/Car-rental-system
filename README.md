## Working

This is a basic Car rental app in which file Handling and Hybrid Inheritance using oops are used.  The customer has to enter his name first Followed by selection of the car model. Then he has to enter a car number which he wishes to have and the number of days he wants to rent the car. On doing so an invoice would get generated.
